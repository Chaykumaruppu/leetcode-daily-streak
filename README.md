# LeetCode Daily Streak 🚀

This repository tracks my daily LeetCode problem-solving journey.
The goal is to maintain a consistent streak while mastering core DSA patterns.

## 🔥 Streak Progress

- ✅ Day 001 — Meeting Rooms III (Heaps + Greedy)
- ✅ Day 002 — Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix (Matrix Traversal)
  
## 🧠 Focus Areas
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Problem-solving consistency
- Interview-ready Python solutions

## 🛠️ Language
- Python

## 📌 Notes
- Each day contains:
  - A clear problem explanation (`README.md`)
  - A clean, working Python solution (`solution.py`)
- Solutions are written without Python type hints for maximum compatibility.
