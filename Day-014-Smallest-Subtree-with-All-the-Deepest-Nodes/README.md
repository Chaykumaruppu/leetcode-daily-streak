# Day 14 – Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes- 865

## Approach
- Use DFS to compute depth of left and right subtrees
- Compare depths to determine the lowest common ancestor
- Return subtree root containing all deepest nodes

## Key Concepts
- Binary Tree
- Depth-first search
- Lowest Common Ancestor

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(h)
