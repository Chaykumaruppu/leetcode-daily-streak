# Day 12 – Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree - 1339

## Approach
- Compute subtree sums using DFS
- Try splitting at every node
- Maximize product of (subtree sum × remaining sum)

## Key Concepts
- Binary Tree
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Subtree sums

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
