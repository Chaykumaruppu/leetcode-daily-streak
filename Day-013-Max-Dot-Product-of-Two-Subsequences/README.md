# Day 13 – Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences (LeetCode)

## Approach
- Use 2D Dynamic Programming
- Track maximum dot product for prefixes of both arrays
- Handle negative values by initializing with -infinity

## Key Concepts
- Dynamic Programming
- Subsequence optimization
- Negative value handling

## Complexity
- Time: O(n × m)
- Space: O(n × m)
